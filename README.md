LangChain Agent Fundamentals – Tool-Based Calculator

This project is a learning-focused implementation of LangChain agents using a simple calculator use case.
The goal is to understand tool calling, agent routing, and LLM orchestration, not to build a complex calculator.

The system:

Uses an LLM (Gemini) only to understand user intent
Routes the request to the correct arithmetic agent
Executes all math logic in Python code, not in the LLM
Displays the result via a Streamlit UI
